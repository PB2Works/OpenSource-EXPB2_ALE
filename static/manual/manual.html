<h3>2. Let's begin with small glossary</h3>
<div class="sub"><strong>Key filtering</strong> - the ability of "interface 
  element" to act as a different tool in case when Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys

  object".<br>

  <strong>Map ID</strong> - unique map identification. Your map ID is what players 
  use to play your map in-game.<br>

	</div><br>
<em>Notes:</em><br>
  - With the Plazma Burst 2 engine, "Crate" and "Rope" objects 
  are "Vehicles". <br>
  - With the Plazma Burst 2 engine, "Allies" are "Enemies" (or "Actors")
  unless they are on the same team as active Player.<br>
  - Player and Enemy objects will not collide if their team is set to "Alpha".<br>
  - Allies won't try to pick your gun if gun is meant for your and ally's team only.
  <br>
  - In the Plazma Burst 2 engine, the Lamp flare effect can be disabled.<br>
  - Destruction of Lamp objects does not guarantee lightmap recalculation. Game will stop trying to do so if first recalculation takes significant ammount of time for player.
  <br>
  - Some of Decorations will automatically generate a glowing effect with the 
  help of "Lamp object" with the flare effect disabled. Additionally they will remove "Lamp" objects around (just so old maps don't have doubled effect).<br>
  - None of Decorations collide. Their collision can be made with the help of 
  invisible Movable object(s).<br>
  - The "Pushing area" object can also deal 2 kinds of damage: basic and slicing. Second spawns hit particles and slices body in half on death.<br>
  - The "Killing ray Decorations" deal no damage by default. Their damage 
  can be created with the help of "Pushing areas" with slicing damage 
  enabled.<br>
  - With the Plazma Burst 2 engine, Acid is Water with damage turned on.<br>
  - "Background objects" are just the background walls. To change the 
  sky texture use the "Engine mark" object or Trigger logic.<br>
  - Shadows are generated only over Background objects in Plazma Burst 2.<br>
  - Plazma Burst 2 engine automatically creates Lamps with the 
  disabled flare effect around Background objects with the brightness based 
  on average brightness of current sky texture to generate the global illumination.<br>
  - Shadow appearance is based on the each player's game settings.<br>
  - Enemy object skills are based on the "difficulty level" which is 
  selected by player. In multiplayer, the difficulty level is "Impossible" by default, unless changed with Trigger logic.<br>
  - Manipulation of the gameplay and the level appearance can be done with help 
  of Engine mark object(s).<br>
  - Not all objects' properties are restored on round change in Multiplayer.<br>
  - Synchronization of most objects
  isn't done automatically in Multiplayer. Synchronization of movables, for example, will require additional Trigger logic.<br>

<div class="sub">
<div class="sub"><a href="https://www.plazmaburst2.com/level_editor_manual/triggers.html">Triggers</a></div><br>
More info might appear here (feel free to suggest).
</div><br>

<h3>7. Approvable maps</h3>
<div class="sub">To learn how get your map approved, you may check <a href="https://www.plazmaburst2.com/level_editor_manual/requirements%20for%20map%20approval.html">Requirements 
  for map approval</a> page. This page also contain some recommendations on how 
  you can make your map better, even if you don't want your map to be approved 
  or your map can't be approved due to it being created for single player mode 
  orientation.</div>
<br>
<h3>8. Errors</h3>
<div class="sub"> Sometimes, when you test your map you might see some Errors.<br>
  <br>
  To avoid any type of Errors, we recommend testing your map from time to time 
  during it's development. This way when your map has an error, it will stop working 
  and you will know what the problem is and the problem could be connected with 
  recent changes/additions made to the map.<br>
<br>
  But still, Errors can occur sometimes. Feel free to ask on our forum about any 
  questions or issues you might be experiencing and we will try to help you. Each 
  time you ask for help on a certain Error please specify the: <strong>Map ID</strong> 
  of the map that has the Error, <strong>Error code</strong> and <strong>LoadMap_StopAddress</strong>. 
  <br>
  <br>
  When a problem is solved we will update following table of known Errors:<br>
<br>
    
  <table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="1" style="background-color:#AAAAAA">
    <tbody><tr> 
      <td><strong>Token</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Error code</strong></td>
      <td><strong>LoadMap_StopAddress</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Solution</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
      <td>Flash player plugin crashed</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Something unusual happends during loading or level execution, 
        for example map requested too much RAM.<br> 
        <br>
      This can happen when there is <strong>Lamp</strong> object(s) with high value of "power" parameter (we recommend values below 1).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
      <td>Players can't swim in <strong>Water area</strong> object</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Recreate the <strong>Water area</strong> object or resize it. It can 
        happen due to negative size of <strong>Water area</strong> object.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
      <td>Game freezes or freezes partially</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>It can happen when game tries to execute the<strong> Trigger</strong> 
        that is contain an error of some sort in it's parameters.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
      <td>Map loads forever (or 15+ seconds)</td>
      <td>1502</td>
      <td>any</td>
      <td>The map was unable to load in the allowed period of time (15 seconds).<br> 
        <br>
        Problem is connected with expensive calculations during map loading, for 
        example: "shadows" in the map are calculations, global illumination 
        calculations, snow generation, wall texture generation, too high "power" 
        parameter of <strong>Lamp</strong> objects.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="left" valign="top">
      <td>Wrong parameter value on background object</td>
      <td>2004</td>
      <td>1309</td>
      <td>Zoom out your map in Level Editor and then select everything with selection 
        region. Then take a look at <strong>Objects list</strong> - there you 
        might see objects which are not selected. Select them with click in <strong>Object 
        list</strong> and manually change their position and size parameter values 
        to correct ones or simply remove these objects.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="left" valign="top">
      <td>Map load fails</td>
      <td>1010</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>While Error code generally says about some object's property pointing towards non-existing object (meaning it was renamed or removed), LoadMap_StopAddress of 8 means it happened during level attachments handling or water objects construction (most probably not due to water). Try to verify properties of attached objects for red "ERROR" values.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>
    <br>
  <em><br>
  Note: This table mostly reflects only Level Editor v1.4 errors. If development 
  was started at Level Editor v0.9 or you had copied some parts from map which 
  development was started in Level Editor v0.9 - please look corresponding section 
  for error solution in <a href="https://www.plazmaburst2.com/level_editor_manual/index_en.htm">Level Editor v0.9 Manual</a>.</em><br>
