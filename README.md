# PB2Works Expanded PB2 Level Editor
This is mod of vanilla PB2 ALE. Modified to work as standalone.

If you want to try it out, you require a webserver. It is recommended to use `webserver.nim` that is already included in this repository if you also want to try out map testing feature.

Get [nim compiler](https://nim-lang.org/) then write `nim c webserver.exe`, wait for while.

Then you can execute `webserver.exe`, you can also set environment variable named `EXPB2` to expanded pb2 client directory if you want to try out testing feature.
